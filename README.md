# Deep Learning CNN for Image Recognition

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image recognition tasks. The model is trained to classify images into different categories using deep learning techniques. This repository contains all the code, data, and resources needed to understand and replicate the project.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Image normalization and augmentation for better model generalization.
- **Model Architecture:** A custom CNN model built using Keras and TensorFlow, designed to achieve high accuracy in image classification tasks.
- **Training & Evaluation:** Detailed training process with hyperparameter tuning and evaluation on a test dataset.
- **Visualization:** Visual representations of training progress, model performance, and classification results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
